Android application to learn the basics of computing programming through physical blocks.

It uses Google's Blockly library, specifically the [Maze game](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/maze?lang=en).

## Install
It's a simple Android App, so install it on your device via apk file.

To use it you need to install on your device the 
[OpenCV Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine) application, free from the Google Play Store.

## How to use
In "immagini" folder there is the file "Originale.png" with all the commands supported by the app, to print and use 
to create your own scripts. 

Besides, in the folder there are ten examples (Lvl1.png, Lvl2.png, Lvl3.png, ...),
